<h1>The importance of bees</h1>
  
  <br><p  class="other">
   Bees are an important part of the natural environment but sometimes we take them for granted. Maybe it’s because we don’t realise how important they really are? These hard-working winged invertebrates have been around for millions of years, pollinating our plants and producing the sweet golden syrup we call honey.A world without bees is sadly becoming more of a possibility, as these important insects are in severe decline. If bees were to become extinct the planet could be in serious trouble, because these creatures are such an integral part of most ecosystems. Bees including honey bees, bumble bees and solitary bees – are very important because they pollinate food crops. Pollination is where insects move pollen from one plant to another, fertilising the plants so that they can produce fruit, vegetables, seeds and so on. If all the bees went extinct, it would destroy the delicate balance of the Earth’s ecosystem and affect global food supplies.  </p></br>
