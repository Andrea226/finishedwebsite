Bees and trees belong together. The honeybees and stingless bees have originally developed in forest biotopes.It takes more than soil, water, and sunshine to make the world green. At least 30% of the worldâ€™s crops and 90% of all plants require cross-pollination to spread and thrive, and here in Canada, bees are our most important pollinators.Unfortunately, bee populations here and around the world are in decline.Climate change causes some flowers to bloom earlier or later than usual, leaving bees with fewer food sources at the start of the season. Bees suffer habitat loss from development, abandoned farms, and the lack of bee-friendly flowers.
