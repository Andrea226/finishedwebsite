  <h1>Why bees play a fundamental role in food production?</h1>
  
  <div class="food">
  <br><p>Bees play a big role in agriculture. They pollinate crops, increase yields, and give rise to a lucrative honey industry. Bees are so important, in fact, that millions are spent renting hives to pollinate farmers’ crops.Over one third of the food we eat relies on pollination by bees, either directly or indirectly. Many fruits, nuts, and vegetables require pollination by bees and other insects in order to yield fruit, and without pollinators these crops could all but disappear from grocery store shelves.More than half of the world’s diet of fats and oils come from animal-pollinated plants (oil palm, canola, sunflowers, etc.).More than 150 food crops in the U.S. depend on pollinators, including almost all fruit and grain crops.The USDA estimated that crops dependent on pollination are worth more than $10 billion per year.Honeybees aren’t just important for commercial farmers. Honeybees are also essential for successful home gardening and are necessary for the production of food for wildlife. In addition, bees aid in the production of alfalfa that is used for feed within the beef and dairy industries. Bee venom has medicinal properties and has been used for treating arthritis, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, cancer, epilepsy, depression, and more.</p></br>
